Executable test case generation tool
=======

This directory contains the test generation tool.
It is organized as follows:
	
* **config/** : contains the configuration files
* **mocks/** : contains mock classes for DiaMH
* **codeparser.py** : contains the code that parses the State Machine diagram
* **configmanager.py** : contains the code that manages configuration files and builds the header of the Java test suite
* **graphtools.py** : contains utility functions for graph management
* **pathgen.py**: the core of the tool: contains the code that builds feasible test paths
* **main.py**: entry point

The tool requires three parameters: 
* state machine graph, represented in SCXML format (https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/)
* language for test scripts (-j for Java, -p for Python)
* file name for the generated test suite

To run the tool with the provided model, just type 
	```
	python main.py ../Model/DiaMH_StateMachine.scxml -j ../GeneratedTests/DiaMHTests2_NewModel/src/main/java/DiaMHTestsMaven/DiaMHTests/DiaMHTestClass.java
	```

Dependencies
